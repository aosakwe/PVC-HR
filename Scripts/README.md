# ECG Processing Pipeline

**alt_HR_Calc.py : Script that processes individual ECG files to generate interval-level data.**

**process.sh: Will process the whole directory of ECG files (executes alt_HR_Calc.py on every ECG file).**

**compress.sh : compresses the folders generated by process.sh.**

## **Usage**

./process.sh Directory Interval_length

Directory: Name of output folder in which to store. **Note** that the script creates a **new** folder.

Interval_length: Interval length in **seconds** (1 hour â€“\> 3600)

## Output:

The bash script will create a folder with the individual processed files: interval_length_DIRECTORY_Outputs/
