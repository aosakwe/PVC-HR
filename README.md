This repository contains the analysis scripts to reproduce the results from the above study. The analysis was run on 1-7 day ECG recordings from patients with a high burden of Premature-ventricular contractions (PVCs).

The results are generated using the [ECG_Figures.Rmd](./ECG_Figures.Rmd) notebook. The processing pipeline and analysis scripts called by the notebook can be found in the [Scripts folder](./Scripts).
